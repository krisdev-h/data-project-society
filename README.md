# Data Project Society Logo

Hi there! For my first GitHub project I wanted to explore my interest in RStudio visualization. Therefore, this repository will describe my process in brainstorming ideas and generating a RStudio heat map for the Data Project Society's (DPS) logo.

With the help of a Data Science Professor and fellow students, we are creating the Data Project Society this year as a non-intimidating community for anyone interested in exploring Data Science. I thought that this would be a good introduction into visualization and help develop my technical expertise, which is essential for guiding others next year.

### Brainstorming
Looking into RStudio visualizations, I decided that a heat map would be suitable as a visually appealing and unique method to construct DPS's logo. Not only is RStudio a staple program that we will utilize throughout the year, but this could be a good introductory exercise in developing models within the program.
